Gumtree QA challenge

Before you start...

Please do not fork our repository to create your project. 
Clone and then work in your own repository. 
Once you are done, send us a link to your repository to gumtreeuk.apps@gmail.com.
Please allow yourself at least 1 hour of uninterrupted time for this task, but feel free to spend as much time on the task as you like and make the solution and the code as perfect as you like.

The task

Ths repo contains the source code for an Android app. 
We would like you to:

List any uncertainties about the functionality as questions for the Product manager (PO), Devs or stakeholders.
Provide your own answers/assumptions to the questions above.
Define the acceptance criteria (AC) for the core functionality of the app.
Put together test scenarios (ideally in BDD format) that would verify that the AC/Requirements are met.
Please consider any additional behaviours that should be tested.
Write automation tests to cover the core functionality of the app.

Some insights into what we'll be looking for (and what we will not):

Your investigation skills needed to write a test that performs a search in the app.
Feel free to commit as often as you'd like.
It's better to complete 1 task than to start 3
Feel free to use any java libraries you feel appropriate
We will be looking at how you approach the task (e.g. how you structure your code)
Good Luck!
